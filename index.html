    <h1>This is My Cheat Sheet.</h1>

<p>The purpose of this document is to display a selection of CSS or HTML rules for future reference.</p>


<p>In this 'Cheat Sheet' I will include how to link external files, including fonts. <br>
There are many aspects of HTML that are needed to present a web page.
There are only a few aspects that can style HTML code and these are reffered to as inline styles. 
CSS is a better platform to apply these styles. Here is a table to show a few of them. This table is also 
created using only HTML. Relevent CSS has only been applied to the 'CSS Effect and Benefit' column.
</p>

<h2>HTML elements</h2>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>HTML Element</th>
            <th>Effect</th>
            <th>Identifiable Issue</th>
            <th>CSS Alternative</th>
            <th>CSS Effect and Benefit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>


    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;b&gt;</td>
            <td><b>Bold text.</b></td>
            <td>This has to applied to each individual element.</td>
            <td class="monospace">element{<br>font-weight:bold;<br>}</td>
            <td class="bold">This applies the bold font to all named selectors in bulk. Faster and easier!</td>
        </tr>
    

    
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;i&gt; or &lt;em&gt;</td>
            <td><i>Italics</i></td>

            <td class="monospace">element{<br>font-style:italic;<br>}</td>
            <td class="italics">This applies the italic font to all named selectors in bulk. Faster and easier!</td>

            <td style= 'color: red;'>Colors text</td>
            <td>This is an inline style that is added to each element.</td>
            <td class="monospace">element{<br>color:red;<br>}</td>
            <td class="color">This applies the colored font to all named selectors in bulk. Faster and easier!</td>

         <tr>
            <td>Background color</td>
            <td style=" background-color: aqua;">Colours the background of the element</td>
            <td>This is an inline style that is added to each elelment.</td>
            <td class="monospace">element{<br>background-color:aqua;<br>}</td>
            <td class="background">This applies the color to all named elements in bulk. Faster and easier!</td>
         </tr>

   </tbody>

</table>


<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>Css is far better suited to adjusting the visual presentation of a web page. The attributes can be added
    to a lot of different elements with only one command as apposed to each individual 
    element in it's line of code. CSS can also use different data packs available to link to or download 
    to increase the visual variety available.

        <tr>

            <td class="Arial">The font is changed</td>
        </tr>

            <td class="Abel">The font is declared as above, this changes it from the default available to a web font.</td>
